**Notes:**
  * You can't merge feature branch to main branch if the pipeline is not green
  * You shouldn't push any tag on (main or feature/*) branches.
  * You shouldn't push any commit on main branch directly 
  * Each release with have same tag on main branch, docker image on jfrog, and helm chart on jfrog 
  * once testing team test the service and the service is working fine. operation team can  deploy the chart with the release name on production environment with separate pipline
  * you can find draft-pack repo here https://github.com/mohamedhani/draft-pack
